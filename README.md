# LLM Mastery

I made this repository to better my skills with AI and develope better AI engineering fundamentals. I'm going to be documenting my development here, while also putting in the final product. 




## Learning Material

 - [Youtube Course (Building LLMs from Scratch)](https://awesomeopensource.com/project/elangosundar/awesome-README-templates)

 The goal that I have with this github repo is to build an LLM in order to achieve better understanding of the AI engineering field. I know basic understanding of the math that takes place behind an LLM currently, but I know if I want to be an AI engineer I have to conduct a lot of self learning.
